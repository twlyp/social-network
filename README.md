# social-network

This is the third project I completed during the coding bootcamp I attended in Q1 2021. This single-page React app is a social network implementing: editable user profiles, friendship function, user search, and a global chat. Password reset e-mails are sent through AWS SES and uploaded images are stored on AWS S3.

Back end: Node, Express, Socket.io, PostgreSQL

Front end: React, React-Redux
